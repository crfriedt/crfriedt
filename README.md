I am a motivated, passionate expert and emphatic listener who leads by example.

I remember being in the first grade and being absolutely dumbfounded that the librarian could search every book in the library in about a half of a second, ever since then computers have been a passion of mine. You can always find me in my office spinning up a virtual machine or tinkering with my Raspberry Pi. I love working on personal projects and have built everything from virtual reality games to artificial intelligence applications, to full stack websites.

There is nothing in the world I love more than my wife Shana, and my two boys Liam and Sydney. On the weekends you will find us at the park throwing the football around or grilling. Being a great role model to my boys and raising them to be great men is the number one goal in my life. 

At eighteen years old I felt a calling to serve and spent six years in the United States Army. During those six years in the Army I was promoted four times and received numerous awards and achievements. My time in the military has shaped me as a person and the way I conduct myself. I expect nothing but the very best from myself and hold myself to a very high standard.  

I am very excited and enthusiastic about eventually working alongside and contributing to a great team! At this time I am currently focused on completing my associate's degree and obtaining industry certifications (I am currently working on the AZ-900 and CompTIA A+). 

I will be open to and actively seeking help desk technician/ Desktop support roles and internship opportunities starting Summer 2022.
